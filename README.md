The proposed exercise is designed in two parts as desired.
1) Web API named CustomerPhoneAPI hosted in Azure
2) MVC 5 application named NintexCustomerUI

CustomerPhoneAPI is hosted in cloud with the default URL as "https://custphoneapi.azurewebsites.net/api/customerphone".
The WebAPI is connecting to MS SQL Server database also hosted in Azure.
The MVC app NintexCustomerUI will run on localhost and will connect to the Azure hosted WebAPI CustomerPhoneAPI to do all the CRUD operations in Async mode.

Care is taken to make the code simple and robust and follow all the desired guidelines.

Kindly get in touch is setting up or accessing the cloud creates issues.
